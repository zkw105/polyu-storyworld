backstory: >
  Simon was once a rising star in investigative journalism, renowned for his fearless pursuit of truth. His career took a dramatic turn when he uncovered a sinister corporate conspiracy involving illegal human experiments.
  Determined to bring the perpetrators to justice, Simon published his findings, only to be met with a devastating backlash. The corporation, wielding immense power, orchestrated a smear campaign that left Alex discredited and disgraced.
  In the depths of his despair, Simon stumbled upon a secret lab where he encountered an alien symbiote, a remnant of the very experiments he sought to expose. The symbiote bonded with him, granting him extraordinary abilities but also amplifying his inner turmoil and thirst for vengeance.
  As Simon grappled with his new powers, he found himself drawn into the orbit of a charismatic anarchist who thrived on chaos and manipulation. This enigmatic figure, fascinated by Simon's potential, became both a mentor and a rival, challenging Alex to embrace the chaos within.
  Caught between his desire for justice and the seductive pull of chaos, Simon adopted a new persona. He became a vigilante who operated outside the law, using his intelligence and creativity to dismantle corrupt systems while battling his own darker impulses.
  Now, Simon is a complex anti-hero, feared by the corrupt and admired by those who see him as a necessary force for change. His journey is one of redemption and self-discovery, as he navigates the blurred lines between heroism and villainy, justice and chaos.
