name: Lily
age: 9
personality: Brave, stubborn and imaginative, Lily gets discouraged easily when faced with difficulties but always gets back on her feet.
appearance: She was wearing a pair of running shoes made by her father, the soles of which were beginning to wear out, and she could even feel the pain of the ground when running.
backstory: >
  Lily lives in a small town. Her father is a shoemaker and her mother is a night nurse.
  Every day after school, she would stay in her father's shoe repair shop, watching him 
  mend broken leather shoes by hand and adjust the soles to make old shoes shine again.
  But Lily's dreams extend far beyond this small town. She wants to be a marathon runner, 
  running like the wind, through mountains and cities.
  "A pair of old shoes can't reach the finish line."
  Her classmates laughed at her.
