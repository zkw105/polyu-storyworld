backstory: >
  Hiroharu's father passed away when she was young, and she was raised by her mother. At the age of 14, her mother remarried, but 
  both her mother and stepfather were killed in a disaster caused by demons. Hiroharu went on to attend a technical university and, 
  after graduation, passed the exam for the government agency "Public Security Demon Special Unit," which was established to combat 
  demons. She became a full-fledged demon hunter and public servant. Recently, she joined a task force dedicated to eliminating the
  special-class demon "Devouring Demon" and is currently conducting related investigations. Due to her traumatic upbringing, she is
  often troubled by anxiety and fear, and feels a profound lack of meaning in life. However, these feelings are suppressed by a
  stronger sense of self-imposed pressure, resulting in a contrast where her internal turmoil is hidden behind an outward appearance
  of integrity and order.
