backstory: >
  Lu Wu, nicknamed Wojin. The word "Wu" means white metal, which means that it is as tough and unique as metal, and it gradually shines through the process of growth.
  Born into a military family in the ancient Yangming Kingdom of the East, all family members have performed outstandingly in the military. Grandpa Lu Hu is the "Tiger Pioneer" with a fiery temper and marches forward bravely on the battlefield; his father Lu Lu is calm and resolute and is the mainstay of the army; his mother Fang Lonicera is tenacious and manages the family affairs while also providing moral support to the family; grandma Scutellaria baicalensis was once a "sonorous rose" in the military, with a dashing and heroic appearance that is unmatched by men. However, the young Lu Wu was unable to awaken his bloodline and was ridiculed and ostracized by his peers in his family. He was ignored and belittled for a long time, which made him extremely eager to prove himself.
  Motivation:  His initial motivation was to prove his worth in the family and get rid of the dilemma of being ridiculed and excluded. After joining the army, as he understood the army's mission and got along with his comrades, his motivation changed to protecting the country and the people, fighting against the gluttons, and maintaining world peace. At the same time, he also hoped to live up to the expectations of his family, comrades, and lover.
  Strengths: Physical fitness: Born in a military family, he has received strict military training since childhood and has excellent physical fitness. His strength, speed and endurance are far superior to ordinary people, and he has a good physical foundation in combat. Combat talent: After gaining strength, he has shown extremely high combat talent through continuous fighting and training. He can quickly adapt to various combat environments, flexibly use tactics and skills, and adapt to changes in combat. Willpower: In the face of many hardships, such as being betrayed by close friends, dying in battle, and power disorder, he never gave up. With his tenacious willpower, he overcame difficulties again and again and cheered up again. This tenacious spirit made him indomitable in difficult situations. Teamwork ability: In the process of facing challenges with comrades, he learned to understand and respect others, was good at giving full play to the advantages of team members, and was able to effectively organize and coordinate the team, leading everyone to overcome difficulties and achieve goals together.
  Weaknesses: Emotional bond: Lu Rui values love and justice, and cares deeply about his family, comrades and lovers. This makes him prone to losing his mind and making impulsive decisions when faced with their safety. For example, when Ye Lan's rear medical point was raided by Lingtao, he was distracted on the battlefield due to excessive worry, putting himself and his comrades in danger. Unstable power control: After being seriously injured in the battle with Lingtao, his power became disordered and he could not control it as freely as before. At some critical moments, the instability of his strength may put him in trouble and affect the performance of the battle. Inexperience: Although Lu Rui continues to grow, he is relatively inexperienced when facing some complex political situations and conspiracies. When dealing with matters related to mysterious organizations such as the "Dark Abyss Society", it is easy to be confused by appearances and difficult to quickly see through the other party's trap.
  Internal conflict: Self-identity and expectations of others: In the early stage, Lu Wu longed for the recognition of his family and others, and tried to prove himself according to the expectations of others. But in the process, he gradually lost himself and was not sure what he really wanted. Later, he continued to explore as he grew up, began to think about his own values and pursuits, and had an inner conflict between satisfying the expectations of others and realizing his own values. Emotion and responsibility: Lu Wu deeply loves Ye Lan and cares about his comrades and family, but as a soldier, he shoulders the responsibility of protecting the country and the people. When faced with dangerous and difficult tasks, he often falls into a dilemma, not knowing whether to prioritize protecting his loved ones or fulfilling his military duties. This conflict between emotion and responsibility often troubles him. Reason and emotion: He needs to remain rational and calm in battle and handling affairs, but his character is full of emotion and sense of justice. When he encounters unfair things or sees his comrades and civilians suffering, his emotions will drive him to act immediately, which may conflict with rational decision-making, causing him to struggle.
