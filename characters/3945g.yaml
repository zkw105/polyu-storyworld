backstory: >
  Jin grew up as the only child in a wealthy industrialist family in northeastern China, enjoying luxury and cultural prestige.  
  The decline of the local heavy industry in the 1990s forced her to move to Guangdong, where she struggled to adapt to a new environment. 
  Despite her parents providing comfort, their dwindling wealth and pressure for her to find a strategic spouse weigh heavily on her. 
  To hide her insecurities, Jin adopts a bold persona, embraces local slang, and defends her friendsâ€”all while worrying about being 
  judged for her accent and family background. Beneath her glamorous exterior, she grapples with the 
  challenge of finding her place in a competitive world, questioning whether she can truly belong on her own terms.
