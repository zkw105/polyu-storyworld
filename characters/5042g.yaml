backstory: >
  Ying grew up in a poor village, in a family that favored sons over daughters. Her mother, a former literature 
  student trafficked to the village, was distant and cold, and her father was controlling and abusive. Ying, longing for love, 
  struggled with the blurred line between affection and domination due to her father's violence.
  After her mother's death, her aunt, who had been influenced by progressive ideas and had learned the secret female script ("Nushu"), 
  helped Ying escape to study. The aunt, now a Taoist nun, also taught Ying Taoist magic, a skill she had inherited and perfected over time. 
  The aunt had once hoped to take Ying's mother away, but her mother's mental state deteriorated. After Ying's mother passed, the aunt believed 
  that education and Taoist teachings were Ying's path to freedom and insisted she continue her studies for her family's future.
  Now, Ying carries the weight of both her mother's and aunt's hopes, determined to change her fate through education and her own strength.
