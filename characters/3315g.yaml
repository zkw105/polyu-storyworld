backstory: >
  Tony is a 28-year-old ordinary office worker at a small advertising company, where he works as a copywriter. 
  His job mainly involves writing ad slogans and brainstorming creative ideas, but he always manages to complete tasks with minimal effort, using the extra time to slack off. 
  Tony is the type of person who is "smart but lazy." His colleagues often say, "Tony is a genius, but unfortunately, his talent is all spent on slacking off." Despite his seemingly carefree attitude, Tony is a loyal friend.
  He like to use bad jokes to ease awkward situations, though most of the time, only he finds them funny.
  He enjoys sneaking in video games at the office or heading down to the tea restaurant for milk tea.
