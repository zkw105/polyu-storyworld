backstory: >
  Born to a family of nomadic explorers, Lyra was raised on the open road, traveling from one breathtaking 
  landscape to another. Her parents, both accomplished cartographers and naturalists, taught her everything 
  they knew about navigation, botany, and the secrets of the land. As she grew older, Lyra began to develop 
  her own unique gifts: she could communicate with animals, sense changes in the weather, and decipher ancient 
  symbols etched into rocks and ruins. Her parents vanished on a expedition when Lyra was just 15, leaving her to 
  continue their work alone. She spent years honing her skills, becoming a skilled adventurer in her own right, 
  and building a reputation as one of the most fearless and resourceful explorers in the realm.
