backstory: |
  In realms of Imaginary Echoes, where dream and sorrow intertwine,
  And melancholic serenity holds wonders yet unseen,
  Stands the Lunar Library, vast and moonlit shrine,
  A labyrinthine haven where echoes convene.

  Deep within these halls, where memory takes flight,
  Lives Maya, apprentice of the Lunar Lore,
  In chambers carved from pale and petrified moonlight,
  She studies Echo Bonds, and secrets they outpour.

  Her days, in hushed serenity, like lunar rivers flow,
  Comfort and disquiet in delicate embrace,
  She weaves through ancient scrolls, where dream-fragments glow,
  Cataloging others' visions, in this illusory space.

  Yet, solace found in Echo Spirits, remains a distant shore,
  For Maya, in her heart, a hidden truth resides,
  No phantom friend has graced her life before,
  The comfort she deciphers, in theory only, hides.

  This absence, like a shadow, trails her studious quest,
  To grasp the phantom friendships, born of fractured gleam,
  How in broken worlds, and hearts, they find their rest,
  And roots take hold in fancy, like a waking dream.

  Driven by this void, a yearning deep and veiled,
  She seeks the Echo Spirits' truth, in whispers and in lore,
  And in the heart of illusion, a self to be unveiled,
  A path uncharted, where shadows beckon to explore.
