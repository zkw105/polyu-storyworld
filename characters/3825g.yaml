backstory: >
  Carrie grew up in a war-torn frontier village, orphaned young after her parents sacrificed themselves to
  shield her from raiders. Forced to survive alone, she mastered stealth, strategy, and diplomacy by
  observing nature and ancient battlefield ruins. By 16, she rallied scattered survivors into a covert
  resistance, using guerrilla tactics to reclaim stolen lands. Though burdened by loss, her unyielding will and
  tactical brilliance earned her the title "Shadow of the Wilds" â€” a symbol of hope against tyranny. She seeks
  not conquest, but to forge a world where wisdom and courage prevail over violence.
