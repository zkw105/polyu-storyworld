backstory: >
  Lady Elowen of Thornshire grew up in a secluded castle library, the overlooked daughter of a war-obsessed duke. 
  Her childhood was spent tracing stained-glass shadows and conversing with storybook heroes, nurturing a secret language
  with songbirds and starlight. Though courtiers dismissed her quiet nature as fragility, she mastered herb-lore from ancient
  manuscripts and wove healing charms into tapestries. When plague struck the kingdom, her hidden moonlit clinics beneath
  the weeping willows saved countless peasants, her melodies on a silver lute rumored to mend broken bones. Now whispered
  to be half-fae, she walks autumn woods with a fox companion, leaving pressed flower sonnets at shrines for forgotten gods.
